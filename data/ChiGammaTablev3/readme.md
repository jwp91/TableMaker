This folder's table data is similar to that in ChiGammav2, with some minor adjustments:
1. The cases are run to much higher strain parameter values (~380 in this folder vs. ~100 before)

2. These cases include the heat release rate ('hr'), a parameter of interest for a priori analysis

There may be additional adjustments.
