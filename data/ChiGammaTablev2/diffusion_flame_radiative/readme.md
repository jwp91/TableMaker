- see detailed notes in the readme in the parent directory
- The fileList shows the data files that were computed by the ignis code. These are not retained because they are in the table and table_3 directory, and you can see the file correspondence in the "cpfiles" file.
- table is coarse, and table3 is fine. (table2 was intermediate and is not retained).
- table holds ODT data. Should be the same as in flamelets_with_heat_loss, which is in the ODT folder (at least the data_radi, the data_adia are adiabatic.)
